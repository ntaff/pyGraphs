# pyGraphs library

This repository contain some functions for manipulating [graphs objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)). 

The librairy now contain the following files :

- `vect.py`: Contains primitives for the treatment of vectors and matrices (with python's lists)

- `basicsNO.py`: Contains basics functions to manipulate non oriented graphs 

- `basicsO.py`: Contains basics functions to manipulate oriented graphs 

- `BreadthFirstSearch.py`: Implement simple and generalized BF search in graphs

- `DepthFirstSearch.py`: Implement simple and generalized DF search in graphs
